# Overview

This Lab will be performed on IBM Data Science Experience platform (datascience.ibm.com). This Lab will guide you to load, analyze and visualize public health violation data to uncover interesting insights about New York Restaurants using Apache Spark, Python and Jupyter.

IBM Data Science Experience (DSX) is the premier offering that seamlessly allows data scientists and data engineers to connect data from multiple domains, to analyze and visually explore the data for insights. DSX brings together the data science development experience accumulated in R, Python, Scala, and Java, intuitive data connectivity and processing capabilities of Apache Spark, and the state-of-art dynamic visualization technology using Brunel, Pixiedust, and RStudio.

## Prerequisites

* Bluemix supported [web browser](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/overview/prereqs.html#prereqs)

## Before you begin
To be able do this lab a Bluemix account is necessary. If you don't have one yet -- or you did not complete the initial set up of your Bluemix account -- follow the steps below.

### Already registered and completed set-up

When you already registered and completed the initial set-up of your Bluemix account, you directly jump to [Create a space in Bluemix US region](#create-a-space-in-bluemix-us-region).

### Not registered

Use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent action for your system) to open the [Sign Up for Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/registration/trial) page in a separate tab. Fill in the form and click **Start your FREE Bluemix trial** to complete the registration. You will receive an activation mail in your inbox.

### First time login

Use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent action for your system) to open the [Login to Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/login) in a separate tab. First time users need to complete a 4-step wizard. This starts by accepting the terms & conditions.

  ![Terms & conditions](images/terms.png)

Define a name for your organization.

  ![Organization name](images/create-org.png)

Choose a name for your space. Typically `dev` would be a good name for your first space.

On the last page, click **I'm Ready** to complete the set up process.

### Create a space in Bluemix US region

For the remainder of this lab we switch to the **US region** of Bluemix. For this, use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent for your system) to open the Bluemix dashboard. Click your account and choose **US South** as your active region.

![Select US region](images/select-region.png)

If you are all OK, you get the dashboard. Otherwise, you will be asked to create your first space in this region -- as depicted in the screenshot below. Typically `dev` would be a good name for your space.
